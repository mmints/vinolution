## Abstract
In recent years, research and development has been focused on the digitalization and automation of farmland. One problem is the monitoring of the growth of the plants and in general the condition of agricultural areas like vineyards over time. In this paper we present an approach that utilizes change detection techniques from the field of remote sensing in order to support the cultivation of steep slopes in the Moselle wine-growing region. Data was collected with LIDAR sensor systems in three ways with a UAV from the air, as well as from the ground by a handheld device and by means of a caterpillar. We were able to show that by analyzing three-dimensional sensor data, conclusions could be made about the growth of vines, weeds and general changes in a vineyard.
